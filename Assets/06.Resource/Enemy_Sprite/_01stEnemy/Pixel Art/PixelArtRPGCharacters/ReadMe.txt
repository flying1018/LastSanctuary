These are ready to use assets with very easy drag and drop for your game.
I have turned these into prefabs that includes the animations so you can directly place these characters in your environment!

This pack contains:
- A Viking (Animations: Idle, Attack 1, 2, 3, Dead, Get hit, Walk Right, Walk Left, Walk Down, Walk Up)
- A Druid (Animations: Idle, Attack 1, 2, 3, Dead, Get hit, Walk Right, Walk Left, Walk Down, Walk Up)
- A Blood Mage (Animations: Idle, Attack 1, 2, 3, Dead, Get hit, Walk Right, Walk Left, Walk Down, Walk Up)
- A Magic Rogue (Animations: Idle, Attack 1, 2, 3, Dead, Get hit, Walk Right, Walk Left, Walk Down, Walk Up)
- Select to show which one you are focusing or help on the targeting of your game
- Spell effects (Blood explosion, Health recovery, Spikes, Spikes 2, Poison, Roots)

- Free update for all that owns the pack, with the highly requested multi directional walking. 
Added up, down, left and right walks to all characters.
